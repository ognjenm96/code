from django.urls import path

from . import views # This imports the views module from the app_one app. This module contains the view functions that will be called when a URL pattern is matched.

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index')
] # This is the URL configuration for the app_one app. It is a list of URL patterns. The path() function is used to define a URL pattern. The first argument is the URL pattern, the second argument is the view function that will be called when the URL pattern is matched, and the third argument is the name of the URL pattern. In this case, the URL pattern is an empty string, which means that this view function will be called when the root URL of the site is accessed. The view function index() is defined in the views.py file of the app_one app. It returns an HttpResponse object with the text "Hello, world". The name of the URL pattern is 'index'. This name can be used to refer to this URL pattern in other parts of the Django project, such as templates or other views.
